<h1>IAKAR - Is Any Kernel Anti-Cheat Running</h1>
<p> This tool lists all drivers and shows which of them are Anti-Cheats. The program only compares strings, as other techniques would be way harder to implemement and would be way more aggressive. The program itself scans all drivers,
compares them agains a blacklisted array and then lists them.</p>

<h1> Features </h1>
<p> You can "dump" all names into a .txt file.</p>
<p> You can view the path of each driver</p>
<p> You can rescan all drivers and see if there's any kernel Anti-Cheat running</p>
